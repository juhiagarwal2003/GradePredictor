# 🎓 GradePredictor: The Future of Grade Forecasting! 🌟

Welcome to **GradePredictor**—where data meets education in a fun and interactive way! This project uses Simple Linear Regression to predict student grades based on their second-period scores (G2). Think of it as your personal grade crystal ball! 🔮✨

## 🏫 Overview

With **GradePredictor**, we take a peek into the academic future of students! This project showcases:

- The magic of calculating the slope and intercept of the regression line.
- Making predictions that can help students aim for those high-flying grades.
- Evaluating our predictions with super cool metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Fun visualizations that bring our data to life and help everyone understand how G2 affects G3!

## 📊 Dataset

Our data comes from the amazing [Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance), filled with insights about students' grades and backgrounds. We focus on two key columns:

- **G2**: The score students get in the second period (our predictor).
- **G3**: The final grade that we want to predict (the prize!).

## 🚀 Google Colab Setup

Getting started on Google Colab is a breeze! Just follow these steps:

1. **Open the Colab Notebook**:
   - Click on [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/) to create a new notebook or open an existing one.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   To work with the code and dataset, run the following code cell:
   ```python
   !git clone https://github.com/juhiagarwal2003/GradePredictor.git
   ```

3. **Install the Required Libraries**:
   Install any libraries you may need by running:
   ```python
   !pip install -r GradePredictor/requirements.txt
   ```

> Note: Ensure your dataset is uploaded to the Colab environment, or you can access it directly from the UCI repository using pandas!

## 🎉 Usage

Once your environment is set up, you can explore GradePredictor:

### 1. Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab

Run the cells in your Colab notebook to see the magic unfold. Follow the code provided in the `linear_regression.py` script to predict grades based on G2.

## ✨ Implementation Details

Here’s how we work our magic:

1. Load and explore the dataset like a curious wizard.
2. Calculate the coefficients (slope `m` and intercept `c`) that guide our predictions.
3. Make predictions for G3 based on G2—no crystal ball required!
4. Evaluate our spell’s effectiveness using MSE and RMSE.
5. Create dazzling visualizations that show the relationship between G2 and G3.

### 🔑 Key Functions

- `calculate_coefficients(X, Y)`: The secret formula to get our slope and intercept.
- `predict(X, m, c)`: A spell that predicts our final grade based on G2.
- `mean_squared_error(Y, Y_predicted)`: Measure how far off our predictions are!
- `root_mean_squared_error(Y, Y_predicted)`: The ultimate test for prediction accuracy!

## 🎨 Results

Our project generates stunning visuals to help us see the linear regression line against the original data points!

![Regression Line](https://github.com/juhiagarwal2003/GradePredictor/blob/main/Regression_plot.png)

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: `3.793981314444265`
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: `1.9478144969283562`
