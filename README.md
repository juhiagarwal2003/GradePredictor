GradePredictor is a playful project that uses Simple Linear Regression to predict student grades! By analyzing the Student Performance Dataset, it forecasts final grades (G3) based on second-period scores (G2). With fun visualizations and performance metrics like MSE and RMSE, this project transforms data into insights for smarter learning! ðŸŽ“âœ¨
