# GradePredictor
GradePredictor is a playful project that uses Simple Linear Regression to predict student grades! By analyzing the Student Performance Dataset, it forecasts final grades (G3) based on second-period scores (G2). With fun visualizations and performance metrics like MSE and RMSE, this project transforms data into insights for smarter learning! 🎓✨
Here's a fun and creative README for your **GradePredictor** project that adds a playful tone while still providing all the necessary information:

# 🎓 GradePredictor: The Future of Grade Forecasting! 🌟

Welcome to **GradePredictor**—where data meets education in a fun and interactive way! This project uses Simple Linear Regression to predict student grades based on their second-period scores (G2). Think of it as your personal grade crystal ball! 🔮✨

## 🏫 Overview

With **GradePredictor**, we take a peek into the academic future of students! This project showcases:

- The magic of calculating the slope and intercept of the regression line.
- Making predictions that can help students aim for those high-flying grades.
- Evaluating our predictions with super cool metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Fun visualizations that bring our data to life and help everyone understand how G2 affects G3!

## 📊 Dataset

Our data comes from the amazing [Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance), filled with insights about students' grades and backgrounds. We focus on two key columns:

- **G2**: The score students get in the second period (our predictor).
- **G3**: The final grade that we want to predict (the prize!).

## 🚀 Installation

Ready to dive in? Let’s get started! Here’s how you can set up your very own GradePredictor:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GradePredictor.git
   cd GradePredictor
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

> Note: `requirements.txt` contains all the magic spells (libraries) like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` you need to make this work!

## 🎉 Usage

You have two fun ways to explore GradePredictor:

### 1. Jupyter Notebook

Open the Jupyter Notebook in the `notebooks/` folder and run the cells like a pro! Watch the magic unfold.

### 2. Python Script

Want to see it in action? Just run the linear regression script directly:
```bash
python src/linear_regression.py
```

## ✨ Implementation Details

Here’s how we work our magic:

1. Load and explore the dataset like a curious wizard.
2. Calculate the coefficients (slope `m` and intercept `c`) that guide our predictions.
3. Make predictions for G3 based on G2—no crystal ball required!
4. Evaluate our spell’s effectiveness using MSE and RMSE.
5. Create dazzling visualizations that show the relationship between G2 and G3.

### 🔑 Key Functions

- `calculate_coefficients(X, Y)`: The secret formula to get our slope and intercept.
- `predict(X, m, c)`: A spell that predicts our final grade based on G2.
- `mean_squared_error(Y, Y_predicted)`: Measure how far off our predictions are!
- `root_mean_squared_error(Y, Y_predicted)`: The ultimate test for prediction accuracy!

## 🎨 Results

Our project generates stunning visuals to help us see the linear regression line against the original data points!
